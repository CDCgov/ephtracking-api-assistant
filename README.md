This web app allows you to explore and build EPH Tracking API queries more easily by providing. From the EPH Portal:

```
The National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network) brings together health data and environment data from national, state, and city sources and provides supporting information to make the data easier to understand. The Tracking Network has data and information on environments and hazards, health effects, and population health.

The Tracking Network Data Application Program Interface (API) is an alternate way for developers to query data from the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The Tracking API provides a standard Uniform Resource Locator (URL) interface with a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted response.
